# [Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12068?parent=catalog) 

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. You'll need to use your advanced Compute Engine and general Google Cloud skills to assess how to build the solution to the challenge presented. This lab is only recommended for students who have advanced Google Cloud and Compute Engine skills. Are you up for the challenge?

Topics tested

* Secure remote ssh access via IAP-enabled bastion
* Firewall configuration and review


## Challenge scenario

You are a security consultant brought in by a Jeff, who owns a small local company, to help him with his very successful website (juiceshop). Jeff is new to Google Cloud and had his neighbour's son set up the initial site. The neighbour's son has since had to leave for college, but before leaving, he made sure the site was running.
