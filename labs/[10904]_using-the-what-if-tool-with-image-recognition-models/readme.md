# [Using the What-If Tool with Image Recognition Models](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10904?parent=catalog)

## Overview

In this lab, you explore the use of the What-If Tool (WIT) for image recognition models. Your task is to predict whether a person is smiling. The lab provides a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is trained on a subset of [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and visualizes the results on a separate test subset.
