# [Explore Machine Learning Models with Explainable AI: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12011?parent=catalog)

## Overview

You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks; you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario

You are a curious coder who wants to explore biases in public datasets using the What-If Tool. You decide to pull some mortgage [data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/) to train a couple of machine learning models to predict whether an applicant will be granted a loan. You specifically want to investigate how the two models perform when they are trained on different proportions of males and females in the datasets, and visualize their differences in the What-If Tool.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so donâ€™t expect step-by-step guides.
