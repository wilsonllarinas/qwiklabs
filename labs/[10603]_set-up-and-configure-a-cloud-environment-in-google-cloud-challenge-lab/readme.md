## Challenge scenario

As a cloud engineer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Kubernetes you have been asked to help a new team (Griffin) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

    * Create a production VPC with three subnets using a provided Deployment Manager configuration
    * Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs
    * Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment
    * Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress
    * Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment
    * Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration
    * Enable monitoring of the cluster via stackdriver
    * Provide access for an additional engineer
