# [Build Interactive Apps with Google Assistant: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/11881?parent=catalog)

## Overview

You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario

As a junior developer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Dialogflow you have been asked to help a new team (Taniwha) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks so donâ€™t expect step-by-step guides.
