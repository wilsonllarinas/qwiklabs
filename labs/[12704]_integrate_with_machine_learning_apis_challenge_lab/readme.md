# [Integrate with Machine Learning APIs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12704?parent=catalog)

## Overview

In this Challenge Lab you are given a scenario and a set of tasks. You then use what you learned in the Machine learning APIs Quest to figure out how to complete it on your own within the time provided! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) provides feedback on whether you completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a member of the Analytics team for Jooli Inc. You are expected to help with the development and assessment of data sets for your company's Machine Learning projects. Common tasks include preparing, cleaning, and analyzing diverse data sets.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.
