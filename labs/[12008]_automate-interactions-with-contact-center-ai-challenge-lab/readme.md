# [Automate Interactions with Contact Center AI: Challenge Lab ](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12008?parent=catalog)

## Overview

This challenge will allow you to configure and deploy the Speech Analysis Framework and be able to leverage BigQuery for insights on data extracted from call recordings on a call center environment. The Data Loss Prevention API should be added to redact the sensitive data from the call transcriptions (such as name, email, phone number, and SSN).

## Challenge Scenario

Your company is ready to launch a new marketing campaign. For that, they would like to know what customers have been calling customer service about and what is the sentiment around those topics. They will be sending the data to a third-party for further analysis, so sensitive data such as customer's name, phone number, address, email, SSN, should all be redacted from the data. Right now all the data that they have is available as call recordings and they have not been processed/analyzed yet.
