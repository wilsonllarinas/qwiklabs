# [Configure a Firewall and a Startup Script with Deployment Manager](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/1736?parent=catalog)

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario

Your company is ready to launch a brand new product and you have been asked to develop a Deployment Manager template to deploy and configure the Google Cloud environment that is required to support this product. To start off, you've been given an existing basic deployment manager template that just deploys a single compute instance.
