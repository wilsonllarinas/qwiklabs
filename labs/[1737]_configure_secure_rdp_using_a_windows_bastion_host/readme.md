# [Configure Secure RDP using a Windows Bastion Host](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1737?parent=catalog)

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. You'll need to use your advanced Compute Engine skills to assess how to build the solution to the challenge presented. This lab is only recommended for students who have Compute Engine skills. Are you up for the challenge?

## Challenge scenario

Your company has decided to deploy new application services in the cloud and your assignment is developing a secure framework for managing the Windows services that will be deployed. You will need to create a new VPC network environment for the secure production Windows servers.

Production servers must initially be completely isolated from external networks and cannot be directly accessible from, or be able to connect directly to, the internet. In order to configure and manage your first server in this environment, you will also need to deploy a bastion host, or jump box, that can be accessed from the internet using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The bastion host should only be accessible via RDP from the internet, and should only be able to communicate with the other compute instances inside the VPC network using RDP.

Your company also has a monitoring system running from the default VPC network, so all compute instances must have a second network interface with an internal only connection to the default VPC network.
