# [Engineer Data in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12379?parent=catalog)

## Overview

You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a Data Engineer for TaxiCab Inc. You are expected to import some historical data to a working BigQuery dataset, and build a basic model that predicts fares based on information available when a new ride starts. Leadership is interested in building an app and estimating for users how much a ride will cost. The source data will be provided in your project.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.
