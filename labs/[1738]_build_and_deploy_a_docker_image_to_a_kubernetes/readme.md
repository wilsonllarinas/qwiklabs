# [Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1738?parent=catalog)

## Overview

For this Challenge Lab, you must complete a series of tasks within a limited time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and task - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

To score 100% you must complete all tasks within the time period!

When you take a Challenge Lab, you will not be taught Google Cloud concepts. You'll need to use your advanced Compute Engine skills to assess how to build the solution to the challenge presented. This lab is only recommended for students who have Compute Engine skills. Are you up for the challenge?

## Challenge scenario

Your development team is interested in adopting a containerized microservices approach to application architecture. You need to test a sample application they have provided for you to make sure that that it can be deployed to a Google Kubernetes container. The development group provided a simple Go application called echo-web with a Dockerfile and the associated context that allows you to build a Docker image immediately.
