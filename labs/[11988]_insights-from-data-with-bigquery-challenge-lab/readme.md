# [Insights from Data with BigQuery: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/11988?parent=catalog)

## Overview

You must complete a series of tasks within the allocated time period. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you'll be given a scenario and a set of tasks - you figure out how to complete it on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

## Scenario

You're part of a public health organization which is tasked with identifying answers to queries related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Obtaining the right answers will help the organization in planning and focusing healthcare efforts and awareness programs appropriately.

The dataset and table that will be used for this analysis will be : bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data. This repository contains country-level datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 globally. It includes data relating to demographics, economy, epidemiology, geography, health, hospitalizations, mobility, government response, and weather.
